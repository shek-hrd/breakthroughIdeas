In a folder /shek-hrd/breakthroughIdeas let's do some fixing on my portfolio: Keep the log of access and changes with the session details in an expandable section on the bottom of the page. When user wishes to send a comment or add another project, get the detailed info about the user, users location, trace pathway, latency, cookies and other sessions details, and log it. Comments: Put a smaller space between the nick and the stamp, both should be aligned top of the line and right next to each other, name right, stamp left, as if the nickname was a prefix to the stamp, but keep the stamps aligned. Use same font for the username as is used for the stamp. When the nickname is empty, show debossed <nickname> as a placeholder. By default focus the comment, send with Enter. Group the comments of one date and user, that follow. Once the user has entered the nickname, show it prefilled, but keep it changable. Let the Add your comment... be debossed. If the user doesnt fill in nick, keep it blank, no User nor anonymous.
